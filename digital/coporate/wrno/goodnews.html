We constantly ask ourselves, what good news can we bring in  a world full of bad news?<br /><br />            <strong class="gray12bold">Good News</strong> <br />            Good News is that the God that created the universe loves you as you are. He wants to give you power to become his child, just for the asking. The word of God says: <br /> <br />            &ldquo;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.&rdquo; John 1:12 <br /><br />            God&rsquo;s master plan for you is for Prosperity, Peace, and Joy. Good news is a lifestyle that begins by accepting Jesus as your personal Savior and Lord. You do not know what you are missing, 			if you do not know Jesus as your avior. Encounter your destiny. And start living the good news&hellip;. <br /><br />            Then the rest of your life will become the best of your life. <br /><br />            <strong class="gray12bold">World</strong> <br />            The Bible says:<br /><br />            &ldquo;For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&rdquo; John 3:16 <br /><br />            We believe the current crises in the world exist, because the world  does not know Jesus. To know Jesus is to have peace and everlasting  life. <br /><br />            <strong class="gray12bold">Outreach</strong> <br />            <strong>WRNO Worldwide</strong> is an international short-wave radio station aking the whole word of God to the whole world. Although we cannot bring every person to Jesus, we can take Jesus to 			every person over the airwaves. We are dedicated to finishing this task in our generation.</span>			</td>          </tr>        </table></td>    </tr>        <tr>      <td>&nbsp;</td>      <td width="366">&nbsp;</td>      <td width="355">&nbsp;</td>    </tr>  </table>  <table width="1000" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">    <tr>      <td background="images/new_bot_tile.gif"><div align="center"><img src="images/2002copyright.gif" width="156" height="28" /></div></td>    </tr>  </table><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="1" /></div></body></html>
