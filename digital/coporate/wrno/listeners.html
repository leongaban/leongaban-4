Although I have been a Christian since four years ago the word of God  has touched my heart, and I am thirsty for more spiritual food. Can you  please pray for me? I am living by myself and I am passing through  difficult temptations. Thank you. </span><br /><br /><span class="headers14"><br /><strong class="Blackeaders14"><em>Listener from Ukraine</em></strong></span><br /><span class="white11">I happened to listen to your &ldquo;Good News World Service&rdquo; by radio. I have  a short-wave radio and at nighttime I listened to your very interesting  broadcasts. The reception is not always good enough. But when it is  good, I enjoy listening to your Radio. I wish I had a book from you. If  I understood correctly it is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Master plan.&rdquo; </span><br /><br /><br /><em class="Blackeaders14"><strong>Listener from Iran</strong></em><br /><span class="white11">I am one of your eager listeners. I wanted to know more about the time  and frequencies of the programs being broadcasted.

It was that which  &ldquo;compelled&rdquo; me to write to you when I heard it on the Radio. This world  needs more light, happiness, and healing and the Lord is the source of  it all. I pray that the Lord pours out more of His &ldquo;oil of gladness&rdquo;  into your life and helps your ministry light this world. <br /><br />Thanks again for everything, and keep up the good work!</span><br /><br /><br /><em class="Blackeaders14"><strong>Listener from Ghana</strong></em><br /><span class="white11">Greetings to you in the wonderful name of Our Soon Coming Lord and  Saviour, Jesus Christ. This is my first time tuning to your station.  And your message delivered has been such a blessing to me. And as such  I would like you to bless me by sending me a copy of your powerful  sermon on cassette tape&hellip;In addition any scripture that helps together  with your frequency schedule to enable me to tune in regularly without  missing anything&hellip;.I want the Lord to open my eyes and mind, on His  words for me so that I understand His ways.
