The United States is one of the few countries that permit such   broadcasters. <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</span><span class="gray12bold"> 4.&nbsp; How much power does a  shortwave station use? </span><span class="white11"><br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   Some of the regional shortwave stations intended to reach just one  country   or a limited distance may use only 1,000 or 5,000 watts of power.&nbsp;  Some   large government-owned stations use as much as 500,000 watts.&nbsp;  In the   United States, the privately-owned stations range from 50,000 to 500,000   watts.&nbsp; All of these are capable of reaching large parts of the  world --   even worldwide when conditions are right. <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br /></span><span class="gray12bold">&nbsp;   5.&nbsp; What kind of programs  do shortwave stations broadcast? </span><span class="white11"><br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   Not surprisingly, the religious stations broadcast mostly religious   programming, and the government-owned stations broadcast a lot of news,   analysis, music and cultural programs intended to promote their own   countries and their points of view.&nbsp; Among the religious stations,  most --   but not all -- transmit programming from many diverse branches of          &nbsp;   Christianity.&nbsp; Muslim and Jewish programming can be heard from  some of the   government-operated shortwave stations in those countries.&nbsp; The  shortwave   relays of local AM and FM stations permit distant listeners to hear  local          &nbsp;   news and music from their places of origin.&nbsp; Privately-owned international   shortwave stations often sell blocks of airtime to religious, political,   commercial and cultural organizations which air a wide variety of news,&nbsp;music, entertainment, educational and inspirational programming. <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   In short, there's something for everyone on shortwave radio.&nbsp;  Within a span&nbsp;   of a few hours, you can listen to the news from London or Beijing,  a church&nbsp;   service from Boston, Alpine music from the mountains of Switzerland,  a          &nbsp;   football (soccer) game live from Australia, a program about the indigenous   peoples of the South American Andes, the Koran being read from Cairo  or   Iyadh, the Pope pronouncing a speech from the Vatican, live coverage  of   the Indianapolis 500-mile race, and the latest releases of Latin pop  music   from Miami. <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br /></span><span class="gray12bold">&nbsp;   6.&nbsp; What languages do shortwave  stations transmit in? </span><span class="white11"><br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   Of course most stations broadcast in the language(s) of their particular   country, in order to reach their citizens who are living or travelling   abroad or in remote areas of the interior.&nbsp; But most stations  transmit in a   variety of languages, depending on the target areas they are interested  in   reaching.&nbsp; Some government-owned and religious stations have programs  in   literally dozens of languages every day, beamed to different target  areas   around the world.&nbsp; English is one of the most-used languages by  shortwave   stations; don't be surprised to hear daily English programs from Russia,          &nbsp;   China, France, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Libya, Japan and Malaysia.   Other languages often heard on shortwave include Chinese, Arabic, French,   German, Spanish, Japanese, Hindi and many, many others. <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; </span><span class="gray12bold"><br />&nbsp;   7.&nbsp; Why is shortwave reception  often better at night than during the&nbsp;   daytime? </span><span class="white11"><br />&nbsp;   &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;   Remember that the secret to shortwave reception is the ionosphere.&nbsp;  This   layer of the earth's atmosphere is made up of&nbsp; small particles  that compact   themselves closer together at nighttime, thus reflecting more of the   shortwave signals back to earth.&nbsp; However, the frequency being  used and   other factors also come into play.&nbsp; In general, the lower shortwave   frequencies (say below 9 MHz) travel better at night, and the higher   frequencies provide better daytime reception.&nbsp; Another factor  is that many   stations only broadcast at local nighttime and early morning time periods          &nbsp;   in their target areas, since most people do not have shortwave receivers  at   their schools or workplaces and therefore tend to listen more at night  and   in the early morning hours when they are at home.&nbsp; Other stations  may   broadcast all day long to a particular target area, and their signal  may be   heard perfectly throughout the day as well as night. </span>        &nbsp;   </div>          Ê <p align="left" class="white11">Now, a few more facts about the ionosphere...&nbsp; This region ranges  from   about&nbsp; 50 to 500 kilometers (about 30 to 300 miles) above the  earth's surface.             Radiation from the sun electrifies the atmospheric gases in this region.             The part of the ionosphere facing the sun will be more strongly electrified             than the part in darkness.&nbsp; Thus the nighttime ionosphere is relatively  weakly             electrified as compared to the daytime ionosphere.&nbsp; The ionosphere  does not             show the same electrical effects throughout all its levels.&nbsp; For  example,             as far as long-distance shortwave broadcasting is concerned, the lowest  regions of             the ionosphere bend a shortwave signal very little, but are very absorptive             during daylight hours.&nbsp; This absorption considerably weakens the  strength             of a shortwave signal.&nbsp; The higher levels of the ionosphere are  generally most             effective in bending back a signal to earth.&nbsp; During the nighttime  hours             the lowest (absorptive) layers of the ionosphere dissipate, thus permitting  the             shortwave signals to arrive with much greater strength than during  daylight             hours. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            &nbsp; <br />            <span class="gray12bold">8.&nbsp; What kind of receiver  is best to hear shortwave radio? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            In general, a shortwave receiver with digital readout and continuous             coverage is best, because you can find stations much more easily by  simply             punching in the frequency you want.&nbsp; &quot;Continuous coverage&quot; means  the             receiver covers the entire shortwave spectrum from approximately 3  to 30             MHz, with no gaps in coverage.&nbsp; There are still many good analog  (i.e.             non-digital readout) receivers available as well, even though you may  have             to guess a bit about the exact frequency you're on.&nbsp; In some countries             (particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America), many of the boom  box-type             radios with cassette players often include shortwave bands. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            In North America, all Radio Shack stores sell a variety of shortwave             receivers with their own brand name (although often made for them by  other             companies).&nbsp; Other electronic stores such as Best Buy, Circuit  City, etc.             sell shortwave radios as well.&nbsp; Some of the best quality name  brands             available in North America include Sony, Grundig, Sangean and Panasonic.             Large mail-order businesses specializing in shortwave (such as Universal             Radio in Ohio and Grove Enterprises in North Carolina) have catalogs  of             shortwave receivers they sell.&nbsp; You can also try a local amateur  radio             store in your area, which may carry shortwave receivers. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            Receivers range from $50 or $75 paperback-book-size portables, to tiny  $200             pocket-size travel portables, to $500 or $1,000 tabletop radios.&nbsp;  There are             even wind-up shortwave receivers that you can take everywhere, because  they             require no electricity or batteries to operate.&nbsp; Be leary of some  of the             very cheap receivers that cost under $100, although some of them can  be             quite adequate for listening to strong stations.&nbsp; Again, always  try to get             a radio with digital readout and continuous coverage from 3 to 30 MHz.&nbsp;  The             number of &quot;bands&quot; it has is not important. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            &nbsp; </p>          <p align="left" class="white11"><span class="gray12bold">9.&nbsp; Why do shortwave stations  not sound as loud and clear as local AM and             FM stations? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            Well, sometimes they do.&nbsp; But quite often, they don't.&nbsp; The  reasons for             this are many.&nbsp; First of all, shortwave signals often have to  travel many             hundreds or thousands of miles to reach you.&nbsp; In that distance,  they are             affected by various factors.&nbsp; There is a lack of spectrum space  which             causes shortwave stations to be frequently packed close together.&nbsp;  This             means that there may be interference from another station on an adjacent             frequency, or even on the same frequency beamed to a different part  of the             world. Countries like China, Cuba and North Korea still jam certain             shortwave broadcasts that are directed toward them from abroad (in             violation of international conventions), resulting in a grinding sound  or             bubbling noise on the channel.&nbsp; Atmospheric noise and static can  disturb             shortwave signals more than AM and FM signals.&nbsp; And there's also  a             phenomenon called &quot;fading,&quot; where a shortwave signal fades up and down  (or             in and out) over a period of seconds or minutes, due to ionospheric <br />            propagation conditions. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            But despite these disadvantages, shortwave remains the only medium  capable             of direct communication from one country to listeners in another country             without intermediaries (like satellites or cable companies, for example).             That's why when a major event or crisis occurs anywhere in the world  -- be             it a war, a natural disaster, a major celebration, etc. -- millions  of             people tune in to shortwave stations to hear the news direct from its             source.&nbsp; It is also a unique way to hear about different cultures,             religions and musical traditions straight from their sources.&nbsp;  We should             add that new, smaller, inexpensive yet higher-quality shortwave receivers             (often with digital readout) are now available in many markets around  the             world, making shortwave radio more accessible to more people, and giving  it             a better sound than ever before.&nbsp; And with the advent of digital  shortwave             broadcasting likely in the near future, the sound quality will improve             drastically. <br />            &nbsp; </p>          <p align="left" class="white11"><span class="gray12bold">10.&nbsp; How many people listen  to shortwave?</span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            The truth is that there are no worldwide surveys to determine the number  of             listeners to a particular shortwave station, or to shortwave radio  in             general.&nbsp; It would simply be too expensive and time-consuming  to undertake             these kinds of surveys. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            The number of letters that a station receives is really no accurate             indication of its listenership either, since this is often affected  by             factors such as contests, giveaways, the literacy levels in different             countries, listeners' abilities to afford international postage costs,             their propensity to write to radio stations in general, etc. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            Some of the larger government-funded shortwave stations like the BBC  and the             Voice of America have been able to fund local surveys in certain countries             to determine listenership rates.&nbsp; These weekly listenership figures  range             from less than 1% up to 30% or more of the population of a given city  or             country, depending on the availability of shortwave receivers and the             availability of alternative programming on local radio stations.&nbsp;  Shortwave             listenership is generally higher in countries where the domestic media  are             largely government-controlled, or where there is a desire to hear programs             from countries which the domestic media do not provide.&nbsp; The BBC  and the             Voice of America have estimated their worldwide audiences at as much  as 200             million per week.&nbsp; Not many stations have all of the technical  facilities             or the number of languages that these government-funded stations have,  but             even if they only have a small percentage of the BBC's and VOA's audiences,             these are still very significant numbers. <br />            &nbsp; </p>          <p align="left" class="white11"><span class="gray12bold">11.&nbsp; Why do shortwave stations  change frequencies so often? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            First of all, some shortwave stations don't change frequencies.&nbsp;  Some             stations use only one frequency, all day and all year long.&nbsp; This  means             that their coverage area will vary throughout the day and throughout  the             year, since the ionosphere is affected by daily and seasonal conditions  on             the sun.&nbsp; (Yes, the sun really affects shortwave &quot;propagation,&quot;  as we call             it.) <br />            &nbsp; <br />            To make the best of these changing propagation conditions, many shortwave             stations change frequencies throughout the day (and during different             seasons of the year), in order to maintain the best possible coverage  of a             particular target area.&nbsp; They use sophisticated computer programs  and             on-the-scene listener monitor reports to determine which is the best             frequency range to use at a particular time of the day to reach a             particular target area.&nbsp; And this frequency range will often vary  according             to the different seasons of the year.&nbsp; All of this is designed  to give the             listener the best possible reception of the station, although it does  at             times make it more of a challenge for the listener to &quot;keep up&quot; with  the             changes. <br />            &nbsp; </p>          <p align="left" class="white11"><span class="gray12bold">12.&nbsp; Where can I get lists  of shortwave stations, frequencies and broadcast             times? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            These days, there are a lot of station and frequency lists on the Internet,             as well as e-mail &quot;DX&quot; newsletters outlining changes in frequency and  time             schedules for shortwave stations around the world.&nbsp; In printed  form, we can             recommend two excellent books that come out annually and are available  by             mail order and in good bookstores in North America and elsewhere.&nbsp;  In the             United States, check bookstores like Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders, B.  Dalton and             Waldenbooks for these two guides. They are the &quot;World Radio TV Handbook&quot;             and &quot;Passport to World Band Radio.&quot;&nbsp; Each of these books contains             exhaustive information about shortwave stations around the world, their             frequencies, broadcast schedules, mailing addresses, faxes, e-mail             addresses and much, much more.&nbsp; The main difference is that the  bulk of the             material in the World Radio TV Handbook is in country-by-country order,             while most of the material in Passport to World Band Radio is in frequency             order.&nbsp; The WRTH contains more schedules for foreign-language             transmissions, while Passport's emphasis is more on English transmissions             and has a more North American focus.&nbsp; They are both excellent  guides and             complement one another very well.&nbsp; But be aware that these are  annual             guides, and since shortwave frequencies are changing constantly, there  will             always be last-minute changes that are not included in either book.&nbsp;  The             WRTH is generally published in January of each year, while Passport  comes             out around October or so. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            There are also magazines that contain information about shortwave stations.&nbsp;In North America, look for Popular Communications, Monitoring  Times and sometimes publications at Radio Shack.&nbsp; In England, well-known  magazines include Practical Wireless and Shortwave Magazine.&nbsp; Unfortunately,  the             editorial lead times that these magazines require makes it difficult  for             them to include up-to-the-minute schedule information.&nbsp; For that,  try the             e-mail DX newsletters and Internet sites.&nbsp; Many shortwave stations  now have             their own web sites which include frequency and program schedules.<br />                        &nbsp; <br />            &nbsp; <br />            <span class="gray12bold">13.&nbsp; Why can't I hear a particular  station at the time and frequency that's             listed for them? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            Well, there are many possible explanations.&nbsp; First, you may be  outside the             station's coverage area.&nbsp; Or the list you are looking at may not  have the             correct times and frequencies, as these change frequently.&nbsp; Check  to see if             the time listed is local time or UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, which  is             the same as GMT).&nbsp; Stations may shift their programming by one  hour in the             spring and fall to account for daylight savings time.&nbsp; Some people  may try             to pick up a shortwave station using a standard AM/FM radio, which  of             course is not possible.&nbsp; Or they may have a cheap shortwave receiver  that             does not have continuous coverage, and does not cover the frequency  range             that the station transmits on.&nbsp; Certain types of buildings (particularly             concrete and steel structures) tend to shield out radio waves of all  types,             so you may have to place your shortwave receiver near a window, or  even             attach a piece of copper wire to the antenna and place the wire through  a             window and mount it outside the house.&nbsp; Solar storms and other  conditions             on the sun may cause a temporary fadeout of shortwave signals on a             particular frequency in your area.&nbsp; And you may even be too close  to a             shortwave station to hear it well.&nbsp; Since shortwave signals travel  up to             the ionosphere and bounce back down to earth, the distance between  the             station's antenna and the first hop back to earth is called a &quot;skip  zone,&quot;             and the signal may not be audible in that area.&nbsp; But rest assured  that even             if you are not able to hear a station's signal where you are at the  moment,             other listeners will be hearing it well in other locations around the             world.&nbsp; This is part of the &quot;magic&quot; of shortwave. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            <span class="gray12bold">14.&nbsp; Would it be easy to put  my own shortwave station on the air? </span><br />            &nbsp; <br />            As mentioned above, most countries do not permit private entities to  own             and operate shortwave stations within their territory.&nbsp; But some,  like the             United States, do allow this.&nbsp; A lengthy application form must  be             submitted, accompanied by many technical studies and plans, programming  and             legal qualifications, and an application fee of over US$2,000.&nbsp;  It             generally takes several months (sometimes a few years) for the FCC  to             evaluate an application, and their final decision may be positive or             negative.&nbsp; A positive response would include the issuance of a  construction             permit, giving the applicant 18 months to build the station.&nbsp;  After the             station is constructed and tested -- assuming the tests are satisfactory  --             permission is granted to begin regular rogramming.&nbsp; This whole  procedure             can take several years to accomplish, and a great deal of money.&nbsp;  While it             can sometimes be done for less, an applicant should probably budget  at             least $1 million for development of a basic 50,000-watt station with  one             antenna, from application to the beginning of regular broadcasts.<br />            &nbsp; <br />            Then, of course, there is the question of operating costs, which will  be             many thousands of dollars per month.&nbsp; Some religious and other             organizations may be able to subsidize these costs, but those stations             which must be totally self-supporting often face great challenges.&nbsp;  It is             extremely difficult to sell spot commercials on shortwave stations,  since             there are no audience ratings for such a disperse listenership.&nbsp;  This same             lack of audience ratings means that block airtime must also be sold  very             inexpensively, and nowadays there are a lot of stations (even religious  and             government-owned stations) selling block airtime in order to pay for             themselves.&nbsp; This brings the airtime prices down lower still. <br />            &nbsp; <br />            The good news is that the lower cost of shortwave airtime has made  it very             affordable for organizations of all types to purchase blocks of time  on             privately-owned (and sometimes publicly-owned) shortwave stations to  get             their message heard around the world, without having to go to the             tremendous work and expenses involved in setting up their own station             (which would be impossible for most of these entities).&nbsp; Some  -- but not             all -- of the member stations of NASB offer airtime for sale to outside             organizations.&nbsp; Feel free to contact each member station for more  details             on its programming, sales policies, rates, etc.</p>          </center>          </td>        <td width="10"><img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="spacer" width="1" height="1" /></td>      </tr>    </table></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
